So I started the course thinking that it’ll be an easy S grade course for me. Oh how wrong was I!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sleepless nights cursing my laptop for freezing while my docker image installed huge CUDA libraries with sentence-transformers; and then finding ways to make sure it does not, and then getting rid of the library itself, it’s just one example of how I was forced to become better by finding better solutions to multiple problems. This is one of the hardest, most frustrating and the most satisfying learning experience I’ve ever had, besides learning ML from Arun sir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/s.anand\"\u003e@s.anand\u003c/a\u003e sir did a tremendous job of designing this course. I feel this course ties every other course together by applying learnings from each course and building further upon them. I learnt development in python and APIs in MAD-1, JS in MAD-2, bash scripting in SC, SQL in DBMS, data structures in PDSA and TDS had applications of each. In MAD projects, we made an app and submitted it as zip file. Here we went on to learn to containerise our app and deploy and also make the process automated. Our apps combined python and shell scripting along with the power of LLMs. Yeah the projects did seem extremely overwhelming but the learning is invaluable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/jivraj\"\u003e@Jivraj\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/saransh_saini\"\u003e@Saransh_Saini\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/carlton\"\u003e@carlton\u003c/a\u003e I’m sure it wasn’t an easy task being the TA of this course.
